# How to faced a simple algorithm problem.
## In this repository we are going to explain step by step how you can think when you don't understand a problem ( A simple algorithm problem). 
The basic problems (c#):

First problem:
```
Write a program that reads your age from the console and prints your 
age after 10 years.

```
Second problem:
```
Write a program that prints the first 100 members of the sequence 2, -
3, 4, -5, 6, -7, 8.

```
1. Separate what you understand and what not from the problem (If you don't understand anything about the problem, don't worry. We'll explain it later). 
2. Keep in your mind what you understand (the logic), don't code. Start to ponder what you don't understand by reading the problem multiple times.
3. If after 20-30 min you still don't understand, code the part you understand, it will calm your mind and avoid stress.
4. Once you finish, read the problem again, focus in what you don't understand and try to connect what you coded with the part you didn't.
5. At this time I am pretty sure you came out with something, if you didn't, choose a word (from the problem) that is pretty vague for you (that you understand in english but not in programming), that will be the keyword, go to documentation or just google  it, it will change a little your thinking.
6. Ok, let's put an example:
   When I face the `second problem` I did understand this first part `Write a program that prints the first 100 members`, but the second part `of the sequence 2, -
3, 4, -5, 6, -7, 8.` was pretty vague (it was understandable in english but not in programming for me). I start to read the problem again and again and again, I didn't come out with anything, so I coded the part I understood.
7. After I read again the problem I didn't come out with anything, so I tried to understand by choosing a word and  google it. In my case I searched for the meaning, because english is my second language. It changed a little my thinking, but still dind't come out with anything. I google again in documentation, then something came out, I didn't notice that every number that is negative is a odd number, so it was simple after that.

Note: In the `first problem` was a little different, I did understand everything at first glance, but I overthinked, because it was too simple and I thought I was missing something. This psychology was because the `first problem` in the book I was reading came after the `second one`, so I thought the difficulty would increase.

8. To conclude, analyse the problem, break it down in parts, think in the logic and then code.

# If you don't understand anything about the problem

1. This time we won't separate, we are going to break it down in little parts and ask `what` in every part. `What is the specific issue we are facing` or `What have I done in similar situations that could be effective here` by setting that mindset you can jump to the `how`.
2. `How can I solve this`, this question start the search of understanding the problem, could be by googling, watching a youtube video, reading a blog in social media, whatever.
3. The time that will take this search will depend on you, during the search, your thinking will change and will open a `door` that's when you will understand the problem or at least a part of it.
